# Summary:
There were a lot of tasks in the process of creating the website. Like the color, how to separate different sections, working on the backend in order to filter the information. For me it was very hard creating the filters... mainly because I kept running the app.js files but I added an extra d for the code. I think for further development we could add and api to map the locations and another thing that could help with development is to add a section for future viewers on their locations and testimonies.
